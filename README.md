# What You Should Remember While You Travel 

"I have asked this question to myself too. I see friends who went to one place to another. I just thought that they are wasting their time and money just to go to a place and then be back home after a week or two. But when I tried the travel for the first time, I realized how fun and exciting it can be. I can experience new things and meet new faces with new language and tradition. After that first travel, there came the second, the third, and more. And I am happy to tell you that the best thing about my life, and what makes it more worthwhile is the chance to travel and explore.
